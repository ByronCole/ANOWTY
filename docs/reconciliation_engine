Daily Driver Utility: The Reconciliation Engine
The app's primary utility is managing the discrepancy between when you work and when you are paid—a common source of SSA overpayment errors.

W2 Effort Tracking: You log hours as they are worked, which is the actual legal standard for SSDI.

1099 Cash Tracking: You log when the money hits your bank account, which is the flawed method the SSA often uses for audits.

Variance Detection: If your employer's reported pay exceeds your calculated work by more than 5%, the app triggers a critical alert. This allows you to investigate the "dirty math" immediately instead of discovering it during an audit months later.

"Safe Work" Dashboard Instrument
The daily dashboard translates complex monthly dollar limits into an actionable "Safe Hours" readout.

Actionable Time: It tells you exactly how many hours you can work before hitting a critical threshold, allowing you to work with confidence.

Conservative Cushioning: In "Exploring Mode," the app uses a 5% safety cushion to pad your estimates, ensuring you stay under the limit even with minor tracking errors.

Progressive Intensity: As you move toward the $1,690 SGA limit, the visual alerts shift from Green (Safe) to Yellow (Warning) and finally Red (Danger).

The "Dirty Letter" Defense: SSA-Ready Exporting
If the SSA sends a notice of overpayment, the app produces a high-fidelity audit trail designed to challenge their claims.

The Audit Report: With one tap, the app generates an SSA-ready PDF.

Verified Content: This report includes a 13-month earnings summary, verification for all daily work entries, and attached images of every relevant paystub.

Technical Explanations: The export includes pre-written technical explanations for any detected variances, forcing the SSA to reconcile their data against your superior records.

Modular Strategy for Legal Defenders
The architecture is designed with a "Modular Route Tree" so it can be forked for other benefits like SSI or VA programs.

Immutable Logging: Once "Defense Mode" is activated, logging becomes immutable and timestamped to prove "good faith" in a legal setting.

Configurable Thresholds: Users or legal teams can adjust the SGA ($1,690) or TWP ($1,210) thresholds to match specific state or federal requirements.
